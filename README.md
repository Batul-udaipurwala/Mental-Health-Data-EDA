# Mental-Health-Data-EDA

#Overview
This project is focused on the detection of mental health conditions, particularly depression, using machine learning techniques. By analyzing various input data, the model predicts the likelihood of depression, providing a supportive tool for early intervention and mental health awareness.

#Features
Data Preprocessing: Handles raw data cleaning and preparation.
Machine Learning Model: Implements a predictive model for detecting signs of depression.
Visualization: Graphical representation of trends and data insights.

#Requirements
Python 3.8 or higher
Libraries:
pandas,
numpy,
scikit-learn,
matplotlib,
seaborn

#Dataset
This project uses a dataset of mental health indicators from Kaggle.
